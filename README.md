## Description:
A collection of mostly POSIX shell scripts (except for sudo-password-stealer.sh).  
All of the scripts are licensed under Unlicense license and belong to public domain.  
None of them take any arguments.  
  
They are mostly useless. I deployed them here, because I use them.

## Overview:
A small description of what each and every script does:  
create-my-home-dirs.sh - Creates directories that are a part of my daily computer usage (I reinstall OSes quite often and manually doing it is tidious).  
recompile-dwm.sh - Removes URG from pywal-generated header file for dwm and recompiles it.  
suckless-software-deploy.sh - Installs and compiles dwm, dmenu, st, slock and slstatus.  
sudo-password-stealer.sh - Bash script that has A LOT of flaws. Should never be used.
